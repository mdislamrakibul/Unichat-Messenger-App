## Introduction

This is a code repository for the corresponding Project. In this Projet, I have tried to create a full Realtime Chat Application with Social Auth and dedicated chat APIs/sockets.

and learn how to build a react chat app using [https://chatengine.io](https://chatengine.io)

Firebase and Chat Engine are greats tools to setup apps fast and easily - great to learn with!
